## File Structure

## Example Workflow
1. User enters their name, a rating, and a remark in the form.
2. On clicking the "Add Comments" button:
   - The form data is passed to the `CommentsContainer`.
   - A new comment is added to the list of comments in the state.
   - The `CommentForm` resets its fields.
3. The new comment appears dynamically below the form in the `CommentDisplay`.
